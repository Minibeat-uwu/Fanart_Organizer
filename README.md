# Fanart_Organizer
One of my hobby is to look for bunch of fanarts from my favourite games, animes, mangas, etc. during my spare time and save it to my computers. However, because of the shear amount of the arts I have, I needed a way to organize it all. So I decided to code one using Java and organize it for me... cause there're too many of them... something like over 30Gb. Don't worry, everything is SFW. It's still not done yet though :3
